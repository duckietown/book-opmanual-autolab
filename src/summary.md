# Overview

```{requirements}
Requires: Passion for reproducible robotics

Results: Basic understanding of Autolabs
```

## Definition
----------

The goal of an Autolab is to create an automated environment for Duckiebots, in which their behaviors can be evaluated.

More specifically:

- If identical[^identicalhow] hardware and software is used on 2 Duckiebots, the behavior should be reproducible in the same environment.
- The environment should be highly controlled and configurable

[^identicalhow] identical to the best knowledge

## Applications

- research benchmarking with the Duckietown platform
- physical evaluations for challenges of AIDO

## Autolab in action

The demo video shows:

- (`00:00` ~ `00:31`) An AIDO participant submitting to an AIDO challenge
- (`00:32` ~ `03:14`) Autolab evaluating the AIDO submission
- (`03:15` ~ `end`) Evaluation experiment results and metrics presented on the AIDO website
